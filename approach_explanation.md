# Document Intelligence Approach Explanation

## Methodology Overview

Our document intelligence system employs a multi-stage pipeline designed to extract and analyze relevant content from PDF documents based on user persona and specific job requirements. The approach combines traditional text processing techniques with intelligent content ranking to deliver persona-driven document insights.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Parsing and Structure Analysis
The system begins by parsing PDF documents using PyMuPDF (fitz) to extract text elements with their positioning, font properties, and formatting characteristics. Each text element is analyzed for font size, boldness, positioning, and content patterns to build a comprehensive document structure.

### 2. Heading Detection and Hierarchy
Our heading detection employs a multi-strategy approach:
- **Score-based detection**: Elements are scored based on font size, positioning, and text characteristics
- **Pattern matching**: Recognition of numbered sections (1.1, 1.2.1), Roman numerals, and structural indicators
- **Font clustering**: Grouping elements by font size to identify hierarchical levels

False positives are filtered using exclusion patterns for page numbers, dates, and copyright notices.

### 3. Relevance Analysis
The relevance analyzer extracts domain-specific keywords from both the persona description and job requirements. It maintains predefined keyword sets for different personas (researcher, student, analyst, etc.) and job types (literature review, market analysis, etc.). Sections are scored based on:
- Keyword density in titles and content
- Exact phrase matching
- Section hierarchy importance
- Content length optimization

### 4. Section Extraction and Ranking
Relevant sections are extracted and ranked using a composite scoring system that considers:
- Base relevance scores from keyword analysis
- Section level importance (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Content quality indicators
- Persona-specific and job-specific content bonuses

Only the top 5 most relevant sections are retained for final output.

### 5. Subsection Analysis
For each extracted section, the system performs granular analysis by:
- Splitting content into meaningful paragraphs and sentences
- Refining text for clarity and coherence
- Calculating subsection-level relevance scores
- Extracting key insights using linguistic indicators

## Output Format

The system generates structured JSON output containing:
- Metadata with input documents, persona, and job description
- Top-ranked extracted sections with importance rankings
- Detailed subsection analyses with refined text and key insights

This approach ensures that users receive the most relevant content tailored to their specific role and task requirements, making document analysis more efficient and targeted.
